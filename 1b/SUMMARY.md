# Document Analyst Solution Summary

## Implementation Overview

The Document Analyst solution is a robust, optimized system for extracting and prioritizing relevant sections from PDF documents based on specific personas and their job-to-be-done. The system uses a two-stage retrieve-and-rerank approach to efficiently identify the most relevant content.

## Key Components

1. **Document Processing**
   - PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction
   - Rule-based section detection
   - Structural hierarchy preservation

2. **Retrieval System**
   - INT8-quantized ONNX version of sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 
   - FAISS IndexIVFPQ for efficient vector search
   - Optimized for CPU execution

3. **Reranking System**
   - INT8-quantized ONNX version of cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2
   - Enhances relevance scoring for better section prioritization
   - Operates within memory constraints

## Container Implementation

The solution is deployed as a Docker container that:
- Uses AMD64 architecture compatibility
- Processes all PDFs in the input directory
- Generates individual JSON files for each PDF
- Creates a consolidated output.json with the most relevant sections
- Works completely offline (--network none)
- Completes processing in under 60 seconds for 3-5 documents
- Stays within the 1GB model size limit

## Requirements Fulfillment

| Requirement | How It's Met |
|-------------|-------------|
| AMD64 compatibility | FROM --platform=linux/amd64 in Dockerfile |
| CPU-only execution | ONNX Runtime with CPU Execution Provider |
| Offline operation | --network none, all models bundled in container |
| Model size ≤ 1GB | INT8 quantization of models (~165MB total) |
| Processing time ≤ 60s | Optimized batch processing and efficient algorithms |
| Output format | Exactly matches required metadata, extracted sections, and subsections |
| Per-document output | Individual JSON files for each PDF processed |
| Consolidated output | output.json containing prioritized information |

## Deliverables

1. **approach_explanation.md**: 300-500 word explanation of methodology
2. **Dockerfile**: Container definition with AMD64 support
3. **execution_instructions.md**: Clear build and run instructions
4. **Source code**: Complete implementation of the document analysis system

## Execution Instructions

Build and run with:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t document-analyst:latest .

# Run the container 
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/input:/app/input -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output --network none document-analyst:latest
```

Place PDFs in the input directory before running, and find results in the output directory after execution.
